Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
libjodycode is a software code library containing code shared among several of
the programs written by Jody Bruchon such as imagepile, jdupes, winregfs, and
zeromerge. These shared pieces of code were copied between each program as
they were updated. As the number of programs increased and keeping these
pieces of code synced became more annoying, the decision was made to combine
all of them into a single reusable shared library.

Version compatibility
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
libjodycode 3.0 introduced a new "feature level" number which changes on every
revision to the public API. Programs can check this number against the number
that corresponds to the newest library interface that they use. Whenever any
function or variable is added to the public API this number will increase.
To find the number your program should store and check against this number,
find every interface you use documented in FEATURELEVELS.txt and choose the
highest feature level number out of those.

In libjodycode 2.0 a new version table was introduced that maintains a separate
version number for each logical section of the library; this table was removed
in libjodycode 4.0 in favor of the feature level number.

Programs can use the `libjodycode_check.c/.h` helper code provided to check
for linking against an incompatible version of libjodycode. Copy the files to
the program's code base, add `#include "libjodycode_check.h"` to the main C
file, and add

`if (libjodycode_version_check(verbose, bail) != 0) failure_action();`


somewhere early in `main()`. Set verbose to 1 to output detailed error info
via `fprintf(stderr, ...)` if a bad version is found. Set bail to 1 to have
the check code immediately exit if a bad version is found instead of returning
to the caller with a non-zero return value.
